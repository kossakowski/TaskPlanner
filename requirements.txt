# TaskPlanner Requirements
# 
# This application uses Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI)
# - json (data persistence)
# - datetime (date handling)
# - unittest (testing)
#
# Optional dependency for enhanced date picker functionality:
# - tkcalendar (for graphical date picker)
#   Install with: pip install tkcalendar
#
# Note: The application works without tkcalendar, but the date picker
# button will not appear. Users can still enter dates manually.
